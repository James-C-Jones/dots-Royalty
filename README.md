LetsHaveKiddos | Royalty
===========================

Just a really cool scheme made from a really good palette from a really decent background.

## Honorable mentions

The dunst notif' being super... outrageously.. laughably large was initially a mistake, but it's grown on me. So now I keep it, it's absolutely absurd but I love it.

## Tools used
i3-gaps, i3lock-fancy or i3lock-color & betterlockscreen, rofi, dunst, kitty, sublime, neovim, polybar, thunar, zathura.

I provide GTK and QT options.
No extra changes for GTK needed, for QT I recommend plastique. If youre on arch [aur/qt5-styleplugins-git]

## If you plan to use QT. 
I made a mistake by uploading ALL of my QT colorschemes. (located in .config/qt5ct/colors/) The only relevant ones you should copy over is oomox-Royalty.conf
I'll make this easier in the future by just deleting the files, but right at this moment I don't know how to do that. Bare with me lol.
